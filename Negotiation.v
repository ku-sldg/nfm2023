************************************)

(** * Manifests 
    [Manifest] defines a single attestation manger and its interconnections.  
    Information includes: 
  asps:  a list of ASPs (measurement operations the AM can preform),
  M : can measure relation (other AMs the current AM knows of),  
  C : context relation (other AMs the current AM depends on),
  Policy : local policy specific to the current AM.
           Minimally includes privacy policy and may possibly include selection policy   
  Other information not necessary for reasoning includes: 
  [key] simulates public key 
  [address] simulates address information and 
  [tpm] simulates cruft necessary to initialize its TPM
